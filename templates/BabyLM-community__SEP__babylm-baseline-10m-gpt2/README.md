# Model Details

## Model Description

<!-- Provide a longer summary of what this model is/does. -->
This one of the two Strict-track baselines 2025 BabyLM challenge.

- **Developed by:** Mustafa Ömer Gül
- **Model type:** Causal language model
- **Language(s) (NLP):** eng
- **Resources for more information:**

# Uses

<!-- Address questions around how the model is intended to be used, including the foreseeable users of the model and those affected by the model. -->
This is a pre-trained language model.
It can be used to evaluate tasks in a zero-shot manner and also can be fine-tuned for downstream tasks.
It can be used for language generation but given its small size and low number of words trained on, do not expect LLM-level performance.

# Training Details

## Training Data

<!-- This should link to a Data Card, perhaps with a short stub of information on what the training data is all about as well as documentation related to data pre-processing or additional filtering. -->

We used the BabyLM 10M (Strict-Small) dataset for training. It is composed of the following:

## Training Procedure

The model is trained with the next token prediction loss for 10 epochs.

### Size and checkpoints

<!-- This section provides information about throughput, start/end time, checkpoint size if relevant, etc. -->

The model has 124M parameters.
In total we train on around 100M words and provide multiple checkpoints from the training.
Specifically we provode:
- Checkpoints every 1M words for the first 10M words
- Checkpoints every 10M words first 100M words
 
# Evaluation

<!-- This section describes the evaluation protocols and provides the results. -->

This model is evaluated in three different fashions:
1. We do zero-shot evaluation on 7 tasks.
2. We do fine-tuning on a subset of the (Super)GLUE tasks (Wang et al., ICLR 2019; Wang et al., NeurIPS 2019) .

## Testing Data & Metrics

### Testing Data

<!-- This should link to a Data Card if possible. -->

For the BLiMP, BLiMP supplement, and EWoK tasks, we use a filtered version of the dataset to only include examples with words found in the BabyLM dataset.
For the Finetuning task, we both filter and sample down to a maximum 10 000 train examples.

*Validation Data*

*Zero-shot Tasks*

- **BLiMP**: The Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs evaluates the model's linguistic ability by seeing if it can recognize the grammatically correct sentence from a pair of minimally different sentences. It tests various grammatical phenomena.(Warstadt et al., TACL 2020)
- **BLiMP Supplement**: A supplement to BLiMP introduced in the first edition of the BabyLM challenge. More focused on dialogue and questions. (Warstadt et al., CoNLL-BabyLM 2023)
- **EWoK**: Works similarly to BLiMP but looks the model's internal world knowledge. Looking at both whter a model has physical and social knowledge. (Ivanova et al., 2024)
- **Eye Tracking and Self-paced Reading**: Looks at whether the model can mimick the eye tracking and reading time of a human but using surprisal of a word as a proxy for time spent reading a word. (de Varda et al., BRM 2024)
- **Entity Tracking**: Checks whether a model can keep track of the changes to the states of entities as text/dialogue unfolds. (Kim & Schuster, ACL 2023)
- **WUGs**: Tests morphological generalization in LMs through an adjective nominalization task. (Hofmann et al., 2024)

*Finetuning Tasks*

- **BoolQ**: A yes/no QA dataset with unprompted and unconstrained questions. (Clark et al., NAACL 2019)
- **MNLI**: The Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference corpus tests the language understanding of a model by seeing wehther it can recognize textual entailment. (Williams et al., NAACL 2018)
- **MRPC**: The Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus contains pairs of sentences that are either paraphrases/semntically equivalent to each other or unrelated.(Dolan & Brockett, IJCNLP 2005)
- **QQP**<sup>2</sup>: Similarly to MRPC, the Quora Question Pairs corpus tests the models ability to determine whether a pair of questions are sematically similar to each other. These questions are sourced from Quora.
- **MultiRC**: The Multi-Sentence Reading Comprehension corpus is a QA task that evaluates the model's ability to the correct answer from a list of answers given a question and context paragraph. In this version the data is changed to a binary classification judging whether the answer to a question, context pair is correct. (Khashabi et al., NAACL 2018)
- **RTE**: Similar the Recognizing Text Entailement tests the model's ability to recognize text entailement. (Dagan et al., Springer 2006; Bar et al., 2006; Giampiccolo et al., 2007; Bentivogli et al., TAC 2009)
- **WSC**: The Winograd Schema Challenge tests the models ability to do coreference resolution on sentences with a pronoun and a list of noun phrases found in the sentence. This version edits it to be a binary classification on examples consisting of a pronoun and noun phrase.(Levesque et al., PKRR 2012)

### Metrics

<!-- These are the evaluation metrics being used, ideally with a description of why. -->

The metrics used to evaluate the model are the following:
- Zero-shot
  - Accuracy on predicting the correct completion/sentence for BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Entity Tracking, and WUGs
  - Change in R^2 prediction from baseline for Eye Tracking (with no spillover) and Self-paced Reading (1-word spillover)
- Finetuning
  - 3 class Accuracy for MNLI
  - Binary Accuracy for BoolQ, MultiRC, and WSC
  - F1-score for MRPC and QQP

The metrics were chosen based on the advice of the papers the tasks come from.
