## Introduction

**SlimSAM** is a novel SAM compression method, which efficiently reuses pre-trained SAMs without the necessity for extensive retraining. This is achieved by the efficient reuse of pre-trained SAMs through a unified pruning-distillation framework. To enhance knowledge inheritance from the original SAM, we employ an innovative alternate slimming strategy that partitions the compression process into a progressive procedure. Diverging from prior pruning techniques, we meticulously prune and distill decoupled model structures in an alternating fashion. Furthermore, a novel label-free pruning criterion is also proposed to align the pruning objective with the optimization target, thereby boosting the post-distillation after pruning.

SlimSAM achieves approaching performance while reducing the parameter counts to **0.9\% (5.7M)**, MACs to **0.8\% (21G)**, and requiring mere **0.1\% (10k)** of the training data when compared to the original SAM-H. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method realize significant superior performance while utilizing over **10 times** less training data when compared to other SAM compression methods.






## <a name="Models"></a>Model Using

Fast state_dict loading for local uniform pruning SlimSAM-50 model:

``` python
model = SamModel.from_pretrained("Zigeng/SlimSAM-uniform-50").to("cuda")
processor = SamProcessor.from_pretrained("Zigeng/SlimSAM-uniform-50")

img_url = "https://huggingface.co/ybelkada/segment-anything/resolve/main/assets/car.png"
raw_image = Image.open(requests.get(img_url, stream=True).raw).convert("RGB")
input_points = [[[450, 600]]] # 2D localization of a window
inputs = processor(raw_image, input_points=input_points, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
outputs = model(**inputs)
masks = processor.image_processor.post_process_masks(outputs.pred_masks.cpu(), inputs["original_sizes"].cpu(), inputs["reshaped_input_sizes"].cpu())
scores = outputs.iou_scores
```
