💡 **Quick test**: Try inputting "The capital of France is Berlin" as premise and "The capital of France is Paris" as hypothesis to see HHEM detect this factual but hallucinated case.

HHEM-2.1-Open is the latest open source version of [Vectara](https://vectara.com)'s HHEM series models for detecting hallucinations in LLMs. These are particularly useful in the context of building retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) applications or Agentic workflows, where a set of facts is summarized by an LLM, and HHEM can be used to measure the extent to which this summary is factually consistent with the facts.

## Hallucination Detection 101
By "hallucinated" or "factually inconsistent", we mean that a text (hypothesis, to be judged) is not supported by another text (evidence/premise, given). You **always need two** pieces of text to determine whether a text is hallucinated or not. When applied to RAG or AI Agents, the LLM is provided with several pieces of text (often called facts or context) retrieved from some dataset, and a hallucination would indicate that the summary (hypothesis) is not supported by those facts (evidence). 

A common type of RAG hallucination is **factual but hallucinated**. 
For example, given the premise _"The capital of France is Berlin"_, the hypothesis _"The capital of France is Paris"_ is hallucinated -- although it is true in the world knowledge. This happens when LLMs do not generate content based on the textual data provided to them as part of the RAG retrieval process, but rather generate content based on their pre-trained knowledge.

Additionally, hallucination detection is "asymmetric" or is not commutative. For example, the hypothesis _"I visited Iowa"_ is considered hallucinated given the premise _"I visited the United States"_, but the reverse is consistent.

## AI Engineers: Stay Updated on Hallucination Mitigation

Hallucinations mitigation is a growing field, that includes both hallucination detection and correction.
Specifically:

- **HHEM** is a specialized model for **detecting** hallucinations in LLM outputs - it identifies when generated text is not supported by the provided context in RAG.
- **VHC (Vectara Hallucination Corrector)** can **correct** hallucinations - fix inaccurate generated content (for RAG or Agents), ensuring its consistent with the context. [Learn more about VHC](https://www.vectara.com/blog/vectaras-hallucination-corrector).

Together, these tools provide a comprehensive approach to hallucination mitigation, helping you to create better and more reliable AI applications.

## Using HHEM-2.1-Open

Here we provide several ways to use HHEM-2.1-Open in the `transformers` library.

>   You may run into a warning message that "Token indices sequence length is longer than the specified maximum sequence length". Please ignore it which is inherited from the foundation, T5-base. 

### Using with `AutoModel` 

This is the most end-to-end and out-of-the-box way to use HHEM-2.1-Open. It takes a list of pairs of (premise, hypothesis) as the input and returns a score between 0 and 1 for each pair where 0 means that the hypothesis is not evidenced at all by the premise and 1 means the hypothesis is fully supported by the premise.


```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification

pairs = [ # Test data, List[Tuple[str, str]]
    ("The capital of France is Berlin.", "The capital of France is Paris."), # factual but hallucinated
    ('I am in California', 'I am in United States.'), # Consistent
    ('I am in United States', 'I am in California.'), # Hallucinated
    ("A person on a horse jumps over a broken down airplane.", "A person is outdoors, on a horse."),
    ("A boy is jumping on skateboard in the middle of a red bridge.", "The boy skates down the sidewalk on a red bridge"),
    ("A man with blond-hair, and a brown shirt drinking out of a public water fountain.", "A blond man wearing a brown shirt is reading a book."),
    ("Mark Wahlberg was a fan of Manny.", "Manny was a fan of Mark Wahlberg.")
]

# Step 1: Load the model
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
    'vectara/hallucination_evaluation_model', trust_remote_code=True)

# Step 2: Use the model to predict
model.predict(pairs) # note the predict() method. Do not do model(pairs). 
# tensor([0.0111, 0.6474, 0.1290, 0.8969, 0.1846, 0.0050, 0.0543])
```

### Using with `pipeline`

In the popular  `pipeline` class of the `transformers` library, you have to manually prepare the data using the prompt template in which we trained the model. HHEM-2.1-Open has two output neurons, corresponding to the labels `hallucinated` and `consistent` respectively. In the example below, we will ask `pipeline` to return the scores for both labels (by setting `top_k=None`, formerly `return_all_scores=True`) and then extract the score for the `consistent` label. 

```python
from transformers import pipeline, AutoTokenizer

pairs = [ # Test data, List[Tuple[str, str]]
    ("The capital of France is Berlin.", "The capital of France is Paris."),
    ('I am in California', 'I am in United States.'),
    ('I am in United States', 'I am in California.'),
    ("A person on a horse jumps over a broken down airplane.", "A person is outdoors, on a horse."),
    ("A boy is jumping on skateboard in the middle of a red bridge.", "The boy skates down the sidewalk on a red bridge"),
    ("A man with blond-hair, and a brown shirt drinking out of a public water fountain.", "A blond man wearing a brown shirt is reading a book."),
    ("Mark Wahlberg was a fan of Manny.", "Manny was a fan of Mark Wahlberg.")
]

# Prompt the pairs
prompt = "<pad> Determine if the hypothesis is true given the premise?\n\nPremise: {text1}\n\nHypothesis: {text2}"
input_pairs = [prompt.format(text1=pair[0], text2=pair[1]) for pair in pairs]

# Use text-classification pipeline to predict
classifier = pipeline(
            "text-classification",
            model='vectara/hallucination_evaluation_model',
            tokenizer=AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('google/flan-t5-base'),
            trust_remote_code=True
        )
full_scores = classifier(input_pairs, top_k=None) # List[List[Dict[str, float]]]

# Optional: Extract the scores for the 'consistent' label
simple_scores = [score_dict['score'] for score_for_both_labels in full_scores for score_dict in score_for_both_labels if score_dict['label'] == 'consistent']

print(simple_scores)
# Expected output: [0.011061512865126133, 0.6473632454872131, 0.1290171593427658, 0.8969419002532959, 0.18462494015693665, 0.005031010136008263, 0.05432349815964699]
```

Of course, with `pipeline`, you can also get the most likely label, or the label with the highest score, by setting `top_k=1`.

## HHEM-2.1-Open vs. HHEM-1.0

HHEM-1.0 is the first open version of HHEM. The major difference between HHEM-2.1-Open and the original HHEM-1.0 is that HHEM-2.1-Open has an unlimited context length, while HHEM-1.0 is capped at 512 tokens. The longer context length allows HHEM-2.1-Open to provide more accurate hallucination detection for RAG which often needs more than 512 tokens. 

The tables below compare the two models on the [AggreFact](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.12854) and [RAGTruth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00396) benchmarks, as well as GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4. In particular, on AggreFact, we focus on its SOTA subset (denoted as `AggreFact-SOTA`) which contains summaries generated by Google's T5, Meta's BART, and Google's Pegasus, which are the three latest models in the AggreFact benchmark. The results on RAGTruth's summarization (denoted as `RAGTruth-Summ`) and QA (denoted as `RAGTruth-QA`) subsets are reported separately. The GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 versions are 01-25 and 06-13 respectively. The zero-shot results of the two GPT models were obtained using the prompt template in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.15621).

Table 1: Performance on AggreFact-SOTA
| model     |    Balanced Accuracy | F1     | Recall | Precision |
|:------------------------|---------:|-------:|-------:|----------:|
| HHEM-1.0                | 78.87%   | 90.47% | 70.81% | 67.27%    |
| HHEM-2.1-Open           | 76.55%   | 66.77% | 68.48% | 65.13%    |
| GPT-3.5-Turbo zero-shot | 72.19%   | 60.88% | 58.48% | 63.49%    |
| GPT-4 06-13 zero-shot   | 73.78%   | 63.87% | 53.03% | 80.28%    |

Table 2: Performance on RAGTruth-Summ
| model     |    Balanced Accuracy | F1         | Recall    | Precision |
|:----------------------|---------:|-----------:|----------:|----------:|
| HHEM-1.0              | 53.36% | 15.77%   | 9.31% | 51.35% |
| HHEM-2.1-Open         | 64.42% | 44.83% | 31.86% | 75.58% |
| GPT-3.5-Turbo zero-shot | 58.49%   | 29.72% | 18.14% | 82.22%    |
| GPT-4 06-13 zero-shot   | 62.62%   | 40.59% | 26.96% | 82.09%    |

Table 3: Performance on RAGTruth-QA
| model     |    Balanced Accuracy | F1         | Recall    | Precision |
|:----------------------|---------:|-----------:|----------:|----------:|
| HHEM-1.0              | 52.58% | 19.40%   | 16.25% | 24.07% |
| HHEM-2.1-Open         | 74.28% | 60.00% | 54.38% | 66.92% |
| GPT-3.5-Turbo zero-shot | 56.16%   | 25.00% | 18.13% | 40.28%    |
| GPT-4 06-13 zero-shot   | 74.11%   | 57.78% | 56.88% | 58.71%    |

The tables above show that HHEM-2.1-Open has a significant improvement over HHEM-1.0 in the RAGTruth-Summ and RAGTruth-QA benchmarks, while it has a slight decrease in the AggreFact-SOTA benchmark. However, when interpreting these results, please note that AggreFact-SOTA is evaluated on relatively older types of LLMs:
- LLMs in AggreFact-SOTA: T5, BART, and Pegasus;
- LLMs in RAGTruth: GPT-4-0613, GPT-3.5-turbo-0613, Llama-2-7B/13B/70B-chat, and Mistral-7B-instruct. 

## HHEM-2.1-Open vs. GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4

From the tables above we can also conclude that HHEM-2.1-Open outperforms both GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 in all three benchmarks. The quantitative advantage of HHEM-2.1-Open over GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 is summarized in Table 4 below.

Table 4: Percentage points of HHEM-2.1-Open's balanced accuracies over GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4
|      |    AggreFact-SOTA | RAGTruth-Summ | RAGTruth-QA |
|:----------------------|---------:|-----------:|----------:|
| HHEM-2.1-Open **over** GPT-3.5-Turbo | 4.36% | 5.93% | 18.12% |
| HHEM-2.1-Open **over** GPT-4         | 2.64% | 1.80% | 0.17% | 

Another advantage of HHEM-2.1-Open is its efficiency. HHEM-2.1-Open can be run on consumer-grade hardware, occupying less than 600MB RAM space at 32-bit precision and elapsing around 1.5 second for a 2k-token input on a modern x86 CPU.
