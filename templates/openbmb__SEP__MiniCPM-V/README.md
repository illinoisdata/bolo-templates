## MiniCPM-V
### News
- [2025.01.14] 🔥🔥 We open source [**MiniCPM-o 2.6**](https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM-o-2_6), with significant performance improvement over **MiniCPM-V 2.6**, and support real-time speech-to-speech conversation and multimodal live streaming. Try it now.
- [2024.08.06] 🔥 We open-source [**MiniCPM-V 2.6**](https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM-V-2_6), which outperforms GPT-4V on single image, multi-image and video understanding. It advances popular features of MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5, and can support real-time video understanding on iPad.
- [2024.05.20] 🔥 GPT-4V level multimodal model [**MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5**](https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5) is out.
- [2024.04.11] 🔥 [**MiniCPM-V 2.0**](https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM-V-2) is out.
  

**MiniCPM-V** (i.e., OmniLMM-3B) is an efficient version with promising performance for deployment. The model is built based on SigLip-400M and [MiniCPM-2.4B](https://github.com/OpenBMB/MiniCPM/), connected by a perceiver resampler. Notable features of OmniLMM-3B include:

- ⚡️ **High Efficiency.** 

  MiniCPM-V can be **efficiently deployed on most GPU cards and personal computers**, and **even on end devices such as mobile phones**. In terms of visual encoding, we compress the image representations into 64 tokens via a perceiver resampler, which is significantly fewer than other LMMs based on MLP architecture (typically > 512 tokens). This allows OmniLMM-3B to operate with **much less memory cost and higher speed during inference**.

- 🔥 **Promising Performance.** 

  MiniCPM-V achieves **state-of-the-art performance** on multiple benchmarks (including MMMU, MME, and MMbech, etc) among models with comparable sizes, surpassing existing LMMs built on Phi-2. It even **achieves comparable or better performance than the 9.6B Qwen-VL-Chat**.

- 🙌 **Bilingual Support.** 

  MiniCPM-V is **the first end-deployable LMM supporting bilingual multimodal interaction in English and Chinese**. This is achieved by generalizing multimodal capabilities across languages, a technique from the ICLR 2024 spotlight [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12038).

## Usage
Inference using Huggingface transformers on Nivdia GPUs or Mac with MPS (Apple silicon or AMD GPUs). Requirements tested on python 3.10：
```
Pillow==10.1.0
timm==0.9.10
torch==2.1.2
torchvision==0.16.2
transformers==4.36.0
sentencepiece==0.1.99
```

```python
# test.py
import torch
from PIL import Image
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('openbmb/MiniCPM-V', trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
# For Nvidia GPUs support BF16 (like A100, H100, RTX3090)
model = model.to(device='cuda', dtype=torch.bfloat16)
# For Nvidia GPUs do NOT support BF16 (like V100, T4, RTX2080)
#model = model.to(device='cuda', dtype=torch.float16)
# For Mac with MPS (Apple silicon or AMD GPUs).
# Run with `PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1 python test.py`
#model = model.to(device='mps', dtype=torch.float16)

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('openbmb/MiniCPM-V', trust_remote_code=True)
model.eval()

image = Image.open('xx.jpg').convert('RGB')
question = 'What is in the image?'
msgs = [{'role': 'user', 'content': question}]

res, context, _ = model.chat(
    image=image,
    msgs=msgs,
    context=None,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    sampling=True,
    temperature=0.7
)
print(res)
```
