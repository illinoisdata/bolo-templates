- text: National Commercial Bank (NCB), Saudi Arabia’s largest lender by assets, agreed
    to buy rival Samba Financial Group for $15 billion in the biggest banking takeover
    this year.NCB will pay 28.45 riyals ($7.58) for each Samba share, according to
    a statement on Sunday, valuing it at about 55.7 billion riyals. NCB will offer
    0.739 new shares for each Samba share, at the lower end of the 0.736-0.787 ratio
    the banks set when they signed an initial framework agreement in June.The offer
    is a 3.5% premium to Samba’s Oct. 8 closing price of 27.50 riyals and about 24%
    higher than the level the shares traded at before the talks were made public.
    Bloomberg News first reported the merger discussions.The new bank will have total
    assets of more than $220 billion, creating the Gulf region’s third-largest lender.
    The entity’s $46 billion market capitalization nearly matches that of Qatar National
    Bank QPSC, which is still the Middle East’s biggest lender with about $268 billion
    of assets.

### PEGASUS for Financial Summarization 

This model was fine-tuned on a novel financial news dataset, which consists of 2K articles from [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/europe), on topics such as stock, markets, currencies, rate and cryptocurrencies. 

It is based on the [PEGASUS](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/pegasus.html) model and in particular PEGASUS fine-tuned on the Extreme Summarization (XSum) dataset: [google/pegasus-xsum model](https://huggingface.co/google/pegasus-xsum). PEGASUS was originally proposed by Jingqing Zhang, Yao Zhao, Mohammad Saleh and Peter J. Liu in [PEGASUS: Pre-training with Extracted Gap-sentences for Abstractive Summarization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.08777.pdf). 

*Note: This model serves as a base version. For an even more advanced model with significantly enhanced performance, please check out our [advanced version](https://rapidapi.com/medoid-ai-medoid-ai-default/api/financial-summarization-advanced) on Rapid API. The advanced model offers more than a 16% increase in ROUGE scores (similarity to a human-generated summary) compared to our base model. Moreover, our advanced model also offers several convenient plans tailored to different use cases and workloads, ensuring a seamless experience for both personal and enterprise access.*

### How to use 
We provide a simple snippet of how to use this model for the task of financial summarization in PyTorch.

```Python
from transformers import PegasusTokenizer, PegasusForConditionalGeneration, TFPegasusForConditionalGeneration

# Let's load the model and the tokenizer 
model_name = "human-centered-summarization/financial-summarization-pegasus"
tokenizer = PegasusTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = PegasusForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name) # If you want to use the Tensorflow model 
                                                                    # just replace with TFPegasusForConditionalGeneration


# Some text to summarize here
text_to_summarize = "National Commercial Bank (NCB), Saudi Arabia’s largest lender by assets, agreed to buy rival Samba Financial Group for $15 billion in the biggest banking takeover this year.NCB will pay 28.45 riyals ($7.58) for each Samba share, according to a statement on Sunday, valuing it at about 55.7 billion riyals. NCB will offer 0.739 new shares for each Samba share, at the lower end of the 0.736-0.787 ratio the banks set when they signed an initial framework agreement in June.The offer is a 3.5% premium to Samba’s Oct. 8 closing price of 27.50 riyals and about 24% higher than the level the shares traded at before the talks were made public. Bloomberg News first reported the merger discussions.The new bank will have total assets of more than $220 billion, creating the Gulf region’s third-largest lender. The entity’s $46 billion market capitalization nearly matches that of Qatar National Bank QPSC, which is still the Middle East’s biggest lender with about $268 billion of assets."

# Tokenize our text
# If you want to run the code in Tensorflow, please remember to return the particular tensors as simply as using return_tensors = 'tf'
input_ids = tokenizer(text_to_summarize, return_tensors="pt").input_ids

# Generate the output (Here, we use beam search but you can also use any other strategy you like)
output = model.generate(
    input_ids, 
    max_length=32, 
    num_beams=5, 
    early_stopping=True
)

# Finally, we can print the generated summary
print(tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
# Generated Output: Saudi bank to pay a 3.5% premium to Samba share price. Gulf region’s third-largest lender will have total assets of $220 billion
```
