# distilrubert-small-cased-conversational
Conversational DistilRuBERT-small \(Russian, cased, 2‑layer, 768‑hidden, 12‑heads, 107M parameters\) was trained on OpenSubtitles\[1\], [Dirty](https://d3.ru/), [Pikabu](https://pikabu.ru/), and a Social Media segment of Taiga corpus\[2\] (as [Conversational RuBERT](https://huggingface.co/DeepPavlov/rubert-base-cased-conversational)). It can be considered as small copy of [Conversational DistilRuBERT-base](https://huggingface.co/DeepPavlov/distilrubert-base-cased-conversational).

Our DistilRuBERT-small was highly inspired by \[3\], \[4\]. Namely, we used 
* KL loss (between teacher and student output logits)
* MLM loss (between tokens labels and student output logits)
* Cosine embedding loss (between averaged six consecutive hidden states from teacher's encoder and one hidden state of the student)
* MSE loss (between averaged six consecutive attention maps from teacher's encoder and one attention map of the student)

The model was trained for about 80 hrs. on 8 nVIDIA Tesla P100-SXM2.0 16Gb.

To evaluate improvements in the inference speed, we ran teacher and student models on random sequences with seq_len=512, batch_size = 16 (for throughput) and batch_size=1 (for latency). 
All tests were performed on Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2698 v4 @ 2.20GHz and nVIDIA Tesla P100-SXM2.0 16Gb.

To evaluate model quality, we fine-tuned DistilRuBERT-small on classification, NER and question answering tasks. Scores and archives with fine-tuned models can be found in [DeepPavlov docs](http://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/master/features/overview.html#models). Also, results could be found in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02340) Tables 1&2 as well as performance benchmarks and training details.
