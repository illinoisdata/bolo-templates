# Model Card for esmc-300m-2024-12

ESM Cambrian is a parallel model family to our flagship ESM3 generative models. While ESM3 focuses on controllable generation of proteins for therapeutic and many other applications, ESM C focuses on creating representations of the underlying biology of proteins. ESM C scales up data and training compute to deliver dramatic performance improvements over ESM2.

The ESM family of models has consistently set the state of the art for protein language models. Now ESM C unlocks a new frontier of performance with scaling up to 6 billion parameters. The ESM C family delivers significant inference time performance gains, matching and even exceeding the capabilities of far larger previous generation models. 
## Usage

Using `ESMC` requires [esm](https://github.com/evolutionaryscale/esm)

```
pip install esm
```

Please refer to the readme and notebooks in the [esm repository](https://github.com/evolutionaryscale/esm) for details on how to use the model.
