# Swallow

Our Swallow model has undergone continual pre-training from the [Llama 2 family](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama), primarily with the addition of Japanese language data. The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT). 
Links to other models can be found in the index.

# Model Release Updates

We are excited to share the release schedule for our latest models:
- **April 26, 2024**: Released version 0.1 of our enhanced instruction-tuned models: [Swallow-7b-instruct-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/tokyotech-llm/Swallow-7b-instruct-v0.1), [Swallow-13b-instruct-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/tokyotech-llm/Swallow-13b-instruct-v0.1), and [Swallow-70b-instruct-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/tokyotech-llm/Swallow-70b-instruct-v0.1) as preview versions.

## Evaluation Benchmarks

### MT-Bench JA

We used [Japanese MT-Bench](https://wandb.ai/wandb-japan/llm-leaderboard/artifacts/dataset/mtbench_ja_question) to assess the instruction-following capabilities of models.
We utilized the following settings:

- Implemantation: FastChat [Zheng+, 2023] (commit #e86e70d0)
- Question: [Nejumi LLM-Leaderboard NEO, mtbench_ja_question_v3](https://wandb.ai/wandb-japan/llm-leaderboard/artifacts/dataset/mtbench_ja_question/v3)
- Reference Answer: [Nejumi LLM-Leaderboard NEO, mtbench_ja_referenceanswer_v1](https://wandb.ai/wandb-japan/llm-leaderboard/artifacts/dataset/mtbench_ja_referenceanswer/v1)
- Prompt for Judge: [Nejumi LLM-Lederboard NEO, mtbench_ja_prompt_v1](https://wandb.ai/wandb-japan/llm-leaderboard/artifacts/dataset/mtbench_ja_prompt/v1)
- Judge: `gpt-4-1106-preview`
- Scoring: Absolute scale normalized to a 0-1 range, averaged over five runs.



## Usage

First install additional dependencies in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt):

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Instruction format Ver0.1
This format must be adhered to strictly, as deviations may result in less optimal outputs from the model.

The template used to construct a prompt for the Instruct model is specified as follows:

```
<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\n{SYSTEM_PROMPT}\n<</SYS>>\n\n{USER_MESSAGE_1} [/INST] {BOT_MESSAGE_1}</s>[INST] {USER_MESSAGE_2} [/INST] 
```


Please be aware that ``<s>`` and ``</s>`` are special tokens used for the beginning of string (BOS) and end of string (EOS), respectively, while [INST] and [/INST] are considered regular strings.

For the "{SYSTEM_PROMPT}" part, We recommend using "あなたは誠実で優秀な日本人のアシスタントです。"

For the "{USER_MESSAGE_1}" part, We recommend using {instruction}\n{input}

In other words, We recommend the following:

``` 
<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nあなたは誠実で優秀な日本人のアシスタントです。\n<</SYS>>\n\n{instruction1}\n{input1} [/INST] {BOT_MESSAGE_1}</s>[INST] {instruction2}\n{input2} [/INST] 
```


### Use the instruct model Ver0.1

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

model_name = "tokyotech-llm/Swallow-70b-instruct-v0.1"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map="auto")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

device = "cuda"

messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "あなたは誠実で優秀な日本人のアシスタントです。"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "東京工業大学の主なキャンパスについて教えてください"}
]

encodeds = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, return_tensors="pt")

model_inputs = encodeds.to(device)
model.to(device)

generated_ids = model.generate(model_inputs, max_new_tokens=128, do_sample=True)
decoded = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids)
print(decoded[0])
```

## Training Datasets

### Instruction Tuning Ver0.1

The following datasets were used for the instruction tuning. 

- [OpenAssistant Conversations Dataset EN top-1 thread](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenAssistant/oasst2)
- [OpenAssistant Conversations Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/llm-jp/oasst1-21k-ja) was used, where human utterances are included but the responses are not used. Instead, the responses were generated using the [Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1) model.
 
## Risks and Limitations

The models released here are still in the early stages of our research and development and have not been tuned to ensure outputs align with human intent and safety considerations.
