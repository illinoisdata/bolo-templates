# LayoutLMv3

[Microsoft Document AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/document-ai/) | [GitHub](https://aka.ms/layoutlmv3)

## Model description

LayoutLMv3 is a pre-trained multimodal Transformer for Document AI with unified text and image masking. The simple unified architecture and training objectives make LayoutLMv3 a general-purpose pre-trained model. For example, LayoutLMv3 can be fine-tuned for both text-centric tasks, including form understanding, receipt understanding, and document visual question answering, and image-centric tasks such as document image classification and document layout analysis.
