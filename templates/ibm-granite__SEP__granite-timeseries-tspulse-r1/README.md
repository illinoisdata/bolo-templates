# Granite-TimeSeries-TSPulse-R1 Model Card

**TSPulse** models are ultra-compact pre-trained models for time-series data, featuring just **1M parameters** and supporting **GPU-free inference**. Designed for versatility, TSPulse excels across a wide range of tasks including **classification**, **anomaly detection (AD)**, **imputation**, and **similarity search**.

At the architecture level, TSPulse introduces a novel dual-space masked reconstruction strategy that learns jointly from both time and frequency domains —- capturing complementary patterns in a unified embedding space. This is coupled with a dual-embedding disentanglement mechanism that produces both fine-grained embeddings for detailed analysis and semantic embeddings for broader understanding. These semantic embeddings are inherently robust to variations in time, magnitude, and noise, making them ideal for time-series retrieval.

At the task level, TSPulse integrates several innovations:
- **TSLens**: A fine-tuning module for task-aware feature extraction.
- **Multi-head triangulation**: Fuses outputs from multiple prediction streams to enhance anomaly detection robustness.
- **Hybrid masking**: Reduces bias during pre-training, improving zero-shot imputation.

## Highlights

TSPulse demonstrates significant improvements on several benchmarks:
- **+5–16%** on UEA classification benchmarks  
- **+20%** on the TSB-AD benchmark for anomaly detection (rank #1 in both univariate and multivariate)  
- **+50%**  in zero-shot imputation  
- **+25%**  in semantic similarity search  

Despite being **10–100× smaller** than competing models, TSPulse sets a new standard in efficient time-series foundation modeling—combining strong out-of-the-box performance, minimal compute requirements, and rapid adaptability to downstream tasks.

## Model Specialization

Inspired by the success of small, task-specialized pre-trained models in the language/vision domain which achieve strong performance 
through minimal task-specific adaptations —- we extend this strategy to time-series. Since TSPulse offers multiple heads we specialize 
the pre-training for every task through reweighting loss objectives to prioritize heads most relevant to the target task. This enables 
TSPulse to refine task-specific representations while maintaining its lightweight design, facilitating efficient transfer learning 
across any datasets for the specified downstream task.

### 🎯 Specialized TSPulse Variants

We release three pre-trained variants optimized for specific time-series tasks. 


- **`tspulse-hybrid-allhead-512-p8-r1`**  
  🔹 *Recommended for:* **Anomaly Detection**  
  🔹 *Branch:* `main`

- **`tspulse-hybrid-dualhead-512-p8-r1`**  
  🔹 *Recommended for:* **Imputation and Search**  
  🔹 *Branch:* `tspulse-hybrid-dualhead-512-p8-r1`

- **`tspulse-block-dualhead-512-p16-r1`**  
  🔹 *Recommended for:* **Classification**  
  🔹 *Branch:* `tspulse-block-dualhead-512-p16-r1`


To load a specific variant, use the revision argument in the from_pretrained call as illustrated below:

# Example

```python
from tsfm_public.models.tspulse import TSPulseForReconstruction

# ✅ For Imputation and Semantic Search
model = TSPulseForReconstruction.from_pretrained(
    "ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-tspulse-r1",
    revision="tspulse-hybrid-dualhead-512-p8-r1"
)

# ✅ For Anomaly Detection
model = TSPulseForReconstruction.from_pretrained(
    "ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-tspulse-r1",
    revision="main"
)

# ✅ For Classification
from tsfm_public.models.tspulse import TSPulseForClassification

model = TSPulseForClassification.from_pretrained(
    "ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-tspulse-r1",
    revision="tspulse-block-dualhead-512-p16-r1"
)
```


### 🧩 Model Naming Convention

Each model name follows this format:  
**`tspulse-<mask_type>-<head_type>-<context_length>-p<patch_length>-r<release_number>`**

- **`mask_type`**: Type of masking used during pre-training  
  → `hybrid` or `block`
- **`head_type`**: Prediction heads enabled during pre-training  
  → `allhead` = all heads enabled  
  → `dualhead` = time and prob heads enabled
- **`context_length`**: Base Context length of the model
  → e.g., `512`
- **`patch_length`**: Length of time-series patches used during training  
  → e.g., `p8` or `p16`
- **`release_number`**: Model release version  
  → e.g., `r1`

### Usage guidelines

The model is trained with a base context length of **512**. Different tasks have varying minimum input length requirements:

- **Anomaly Detection (AD):**  
  Requires time-series of at least **3–4× the base context length** (i.e., **~1536–2048 points**) to ensure stable and robust anomaly detection.

- **Imputation & Semantic Search:**  
  Require a **minimum of 512 points** to align with the model's context window and enable meaningful processing.

- **Classification:**  
  Supports **any input length**. Internally, the model resamples or interpolates the input to a fixed length of **512** before inference.
