## Introduction
We are excited to introduce **Seed-X**, a powerful series of open-source multilingual translation language models, including an instruction model, a reinforcement learning model, and a reward model. It pushes the boundaries of translation capabilities within 7 billion parameters.
We develop Seed-X as an accessible, off-the-shelf tool to support the community in advancing translation research and applications:
* **Exceptional translation capabilities**: Seed-X exhibits state-of-the-art translation capabilities, on par with or outperforming ultra-large models like Gemini-2.5, Claude-3.5, and GPT-4, as validated by human evaluations and automatic metrics.
* **Deployment and inference-friendly**: With a compact 7B parameter count and mistral architecture, Seed-X offers outstanding translation performance in a lightweight and efficient package, ideal for deployment and inference.
* **Broad domain coverage**: Seed-X excels on a highly challenging translation test set spanning diverse domains, including the internet, science and technology, office dialogues, e-commerce, biomedicine, finance, law, literature, and entertainment.

This repo contains the **Seed-X-PPO** model, with the following features:
* Type: Causal language models
* Training Stage: Pretraining & Post-training
* Support: Multilingual translation among 28 languages
  
（We recommend using Seed-X-PPO model, as its translation performance is superior to Seed-X-Instruct.）

## Quickstart

📮 **Notice**
* **The language tags at the end of the prompt is necessary**, which are used in PPO training. For example, when the target language is German, \<de\> needs to be added. You can refer to the above table for language abbreviations.
* **This model is specialized in multilingual translation**, which is unexpected to support other tasks. 
* **We don't have any chat template**, thus you don't have to perform ```tokenizer.apply_chat_template```. Please avoid prompting the model in a multi-round conversation format.
* **We recommend against using unofficial quantized versions for local deployment.** We will soon release an official quantized model and develop a demo on Hugging Face Space.

Here is a simple example demonstrating how to load the model and perform translation using ```vllm```

Recommended:```vllm==0.8.0, transformers==4.51.3```

```python
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams, BeamSearchParams

model_path = "./ByteDance-Seed/Seed-X-PPO-7B"

model = LLM(model=model_path,
            max_num_seqs=512,
            tensor_parallel_size=8,
            enable_prefix_caching=True, 
            gpu_memory_utilization=0.95)

messages = [
    # without CoT
    "Translate the following English sentence into Chinese:\nMay the force be with you <zh>",
    # with CoT
    "Translate the following English sentence into Chinese and explain it in detail:\nMay the force be with you <zh>" 
]

# Beam search (We recommend using beam search decoding)
decoding_params = BeamSearchParams(beam_width=4,
                                   max_tokens=512)
# Greedy decoding
decoding_params = SamplingParams(temperature=0,
                                 max_tokens=512,
                                 skip_special_tokens=True)

results = model.generate(messages, decoding_params)
responses = [res.outputs[0].text.strip() for res in results]

print(responses)
```
## Evaluation
We evaluated Seed-X on a diverse set of translation benchmarks, including FLORES-200, WMT-25, and a publicly released [challenge set](https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/Seed-X-7B/tree/main/challenge_set) accompanied by human evaluations.
