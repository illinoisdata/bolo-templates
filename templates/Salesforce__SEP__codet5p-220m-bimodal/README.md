# CodeT5+ 220M Bimodal Models

## Model description

[CodeT5+](https://github.com/salesforce/CodeT5/tree/main/CodeT5+) is a new family of open code large language models
with an encoder-decoder architecture that can flexibly operate in different modes (i.e. _encoder-only_, _decoder-only_,
and _encoder-decoder_) to support a wide range of code understanding and generation tasks.
It is introduced in the paper:

[CodeT5+: Open Code Large Language Models for Code Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.07922.pdf)
by [Yue Wang](https://yuewang-cuhk.github.io/)\*, [Hung Le](https://sites.google.com/view/henryle2018/home?pli=1)\*, [Akhilesh Deepak Gotmare](https://akhileshgotmare.github.io/), [Nghi D.Q. Bui](https://bdqnghi.github.io/), [Junnan Li](https://sites.google.com/site/junnanlics), [Steven C.H. Hoi](https://sites.google.com/view/stevenhoi/home) (*
indicates equal contribution).

Compared to the original CodeT5 family (base: `220M`, large: `770M`), CodeT5+ is pretrained with a diverse set of
pretraining tasks including _span denoising_, _causal language modeling_, _contrastive learning_, and _text-code
matching_ to learn rich representations from both unimodal code data and bimodal code-text data.
Additionally, it employs a simple yet effective _compute-efficient pretraining_ method to initialize the model
components with frozen off-the-shelf LLMs such as [CodeGen](https://github.com/salesforce/CodeGen) to efficiently scale
up the model (i.e. `2B`, `6B`, `16B`), and adopts a "shallow encoder and deep decoder" architecture.
Furthermore, it is instruction-tuned to align with natural language instructions (see our InstructCodeT5+ 16B)
following [Code Alpaca](https://github.com/sahil280114/codealpaca).

## How to use

This model can be easily loaded using the `AutoModel` functionality and employs the [CodeT5](https://github.com/salesforce/CodeT5) tokenizer with three special tokens added (`[ENC]`, `[TDEC]`, `[CDEC]`).
This checkpoint consists of a CodeT5+ 220M model and a projection layer and an itm_head layer for text-code matching.

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

checkpoint = "Salesforce/codet5p-220m-bimodal"
device = "cuda"  # for GPU usage or "cpu" for CPU usage

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint, trust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(checkpoint, trust_remote_code=True).to(device)
```

## Pretraining data

This checkpoint is trained on the stricter permissive subset of the deduplicated version of
the [github-code dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/codeparrot/github-code).
The data is preprocessed by reserving only permissively licensed code ("mit" “apache-2”, “bsd-3-clause”, “bsd-2-clause”,
“cc0-1.0”, “unlicense”, “isc”).
Supported languages (9 in total) are as follows:
`c`, `c++`, `c-sharp`,  `go`, `java`, `javascript`,  `php`, `python`, `ruby.`

## Training procedure

This checkpoint is first trained on the unimodal code data at the first-stage pretraining and then on bimodal text-code
pair data using the proposed mixture of pretraining tasks.
Please refer to the paper for more details.

## Evaluation results

Please refer to the paper and the official GitHub repo for more details.

## Ethical Considerations
This release is for research purposes only in support of an academic paper. Our models, datasets, and code are not specifically designed or evaluated for all downstream purposes. We strongly recommend users evaluate and address potential concerns related to accuracy, safety, and fairness before deploying this model. We encourage users to consider the common limitations of AI, comply with applicable laws, and leverage best practices when selecting use cases, particularly for high-risk scenarios where errors or misuse could significantly impact people’s lives, rights, or safety.
