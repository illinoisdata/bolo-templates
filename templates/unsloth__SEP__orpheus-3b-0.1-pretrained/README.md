# Orpheus 3B 0.1 Pretrained

**03/18/2025** – We are releasing our 3B Orpheus TTS model with additional finetunes. Code is available on GitHub: [CanopyAI/Orpheus-TTS](https://github.com/canopyai/Orpheus-TTS)

---

Orpheus TTS is a state-of-the-art, Llama-based Speech-LLM designed for high-quality, empathetic text-to-speech generation. This model is the base model that can be used for many downstream tasks, like TTS, Zero-shot voice cloning and classification.

We're also releasing the training code so you can create custom finetunes of this model for your own use cases.

# Model Details

### Model Capabilities

- **Human-Like Speech**: Minimally fine-tune to produce natural intonation, emotion, and rhythm that is superior to SOTA closed source models
- **Zero-Shot Voice Cloning**: Clone voices without prior fine-tuning


### Model Sources

- **GitHub Repo:** [https://github.com/canopyai/Orpheus-TTS](https://github.com/canopyai/Orpheus-TTS)
