**causal-strength** is a Python package for evaluating the causal strength between statements using various metrics such as CESAR (Causal Embedding aSsociation
with Attention Rating). This package leverages pre-trained models available on [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/) for efficient and scalable computations.

## 🌟 Features 

- **Causal Strength Evaluation**: Compute the causal strength between two statements using models like CESAR.
- **Visualization Tools**: Generate heatmaps to visualize attention and similarity scores between tokens.
- **Extensibility**: Easily add new metrics and models for evaluation.
- **Hugging Face Integration**: Load models directly from the Hugging Face Model Hub.

## 🚀 Installation 

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (for GPU support, ensure CUDA is properly configured)

### Steps

1. **Install it directly from PyPI**
    ```bash
    pip install causal-strength
    ```

2. **Install it from source code**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cui-shaobo/causal-strength.git
   cd causal-strength
   pip install .
   ```


## 🛠️ Usage  
### Quick Start
Here's a quick example to evaluate the causal strength between two statements:

```python
from causalstrength import evaluate

# Test CESAR Model
s1_cesar = "Tom is very hungry now."
s2_cesar = "He goes to McDonald for some food."

print("Testing CESAR model:")
cesar_score = evaluate(s1_cesar, s2_cesar, model_name='CESAR', model_path='shaobocui/cesar-bert-large')
print(f"CESAR Causal strength between \"{s1_cesar}\" and \"{s2_cesar}\": {cesar_score:.4f}")
```

This will output the following without errors:
```plaintext
Testing CESAR model:
CESAR Causal strength between "Tom is very hungry now." and "He goes to McDonald for some food.": 0.4482
```


### Evaluating Causal Strength

The `evaluate` function computes the causal strength between two statements.

1. For the CESAR model. 

    ```python
    from causalstrength import evaluate
    
    # Test CESAR Model
    s1_cesar = "Tom is very hungry now."
    s2_cesar = "He goes to McDonald for some food."
    
    print("Testing CESAR model:")
    cesar_score = evaluate(s1_cesar, s2_cesar, model_name='CESAR', model_path='shaobocui/cesar-bert-large')
    print(f"CESAR Causal strength between \"{s1_cesar}\" and \"{s2_cesar}\": {cesar_score:.4f}")
    ```
   This will now output the following without errors:
    ```plaintext
    Testing CESAR model:
    CESAR Causal strength between "Tom is very hungry now." and "He goes to McDonald for some food.": 0.4482
    ```
2. For the CEQ model
   ```python
    from causalstrength import evaluate

    # Test CEQ Model
    s1_ceq = "Tom is very hungry now."
    s2_ceq = "He goes to McDonald for some food."
    
    print("\nTesting CEQ model:")
    ceq_score = evaluate(s1_ceq, s2_ceq, model_name='CEQ')
    print(f"CEQ Causal strength between \"{s1_ceq}\" and \"{s2_ceq}\": {ceq_score:.4f}")
    ```
   This will now output the following without errors:
    ```plaintext
    Testing CEQ model:
    CEQ Causal strength between "Tom is very hungry now." and "He goes to McDonald for some food.": 0.0168
    ```

**Parameters:**

- `s1` (str): The cause statement.
- `s2` (str): The effect statement.
- `model_name` (str): The name of the model to use (`'CESAR'`, `'CEQ'`, etc.).
- `model_path` (str): Hugging Face model identifier or local path to the model.

### Generating Causal Heatmaps

Visualize the attention and similarity scores between tokens using heatmaps.

```python
from causalstrength import evaluate

# Test CESAR Model
s1_cesar = "Fire starts quickly."
s2_cesar = "House burns to ashes."

print("Testing CESAR model:")
cesar_score = evaluate(s1_cesar, s2_cesar, model_name='CESAR', model_path='shaobocui/cesar-bert-large',
                       plot_heatmap_flag=True, heatmap_path=f'./figures/causal_heatmap.png')
```
This will now output the following without errors:
```plaintext
Testing CESAR model:
The causal heatmap is saved to ./figures/causal_heatmap.png
```

The causal heatmap is as follows:
