Model weights for the final JaColBERTv2.5 checkpoint, using an entirely overhauled training recipe and trained on just 40% of the data of JaColBERTv2.

This model largely outperforms all previous approaches, including JaColBERTV2 multilingual models such as BGE-M3, on all datasets.

This page will be updated with the full details and the model report in the next few days.
