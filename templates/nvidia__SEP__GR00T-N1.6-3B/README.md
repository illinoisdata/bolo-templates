## Description:

NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N1.6 is an open vision-language-action (VLA) model for generalized humanoid robot skills. This cross-embodiment model takes multimodal input, including language and images, to perform manipulation tasks in diverse environments.
GR00T N1.6 is trained on a diverse mixture of robot data including bimanual, semi-humanoid and an expansive humanoid dataset, consisting of real captured data, synthetic data generated using the components of NVIDIA Isaac GR00T Blueprint. It is adaptable through post-training for specific embodiments, tasks and environments.

The neural network architecture of GR00T N1.6 is a combination of vision-language foundation model and diffusion transformer head that denoises continuous actions.

## Model Architecture:
**Architecture Type:** Vision Transformer, Multilayer Perceptron, Flow matching Transformer

GR00T N1.6 uses vision and text transformers to encode the robot's image observations and text instructions. The architecture handles a varying number of views per embodiment by concatenating image token embeddings from all frames into a sequence, followed by language token embeddings. 

To model proprioception and a sequence of actions conditioned on observations, GR00T N1.6 uses a flow matching transformer. The flow matching transformer interleaves self-attention over proprioception and actions with cross-attention to the vision and language embeddings. During training, the input actions are corrupted by randomly interpolating between the clean action vector and a gaussian noise vector. At inference time, the policy first samples a gaussian noise vector and iteratively reconstructs a continuous-value action using its velocity prediction.

In GR00T N1.6, the MLP connector between the vision-language features and the diffusion-transformer (DiT) has been modified for improved performance on our sim benchmarks. Also, it was trained jointly with flow matching and world-modeling objectives.

**Network Architecture:** 
![image/png](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T/blob/main/media/model-architecture.png?raw=true)
The schematic diagram is shown in the illustration above.
Red, Green, Blue (RGB) camera frames are processed through a pre-trained vision transformer (SigLip2).
Text is encoded by a pre-trained transformer (T5)
Robot proprioception is encoded using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) indexed by the embodiment ID. To handle variable-dimension proprio, inputs are padded to a configurable max length before feeding into the MLP.
Actions are encoded and velocity predictions decoded by an MLP, one per unique embodiment.
The flow matching transformer is implemented as a diffusion transformer (DiT), in which the diffusion step conditioning is implemented using adaptive layernorm (AdaLN).
